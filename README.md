# Verilog 

Find some small verilog modules that are so simple that I somehow
happen to implement them from time to time again instead of searching
for an existing IP block, like decoders, counters etc.

Of course, one can easily find such on stackoverflow, your EDA tool's
examples or so, but this may be your source of code properly licensed
under the permissive MIT license, so you are pretty free to use
it. And for me this repository just makes finding them easier ;)
